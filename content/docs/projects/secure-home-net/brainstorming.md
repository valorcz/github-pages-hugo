# Secure Home Network

## Subnet Definitions

Let's start with some subnets definitions:

 * VPN subnet
    * For indidivual users
    * B2B (or rather Home-2-Home) networks will use individual subnets.
 * WiFi
    * Guest
    * Kids
    * Main
 * Docker/VMs
    * For any kind of VMs, Kubernetes, etc.
 * Infrastruktura
    * Switches, routers, APs, management interfaces of NAS, anything else fitting this category (e.g. Docker mgmt)
    * LDAP, Kerberos, Keycloak
 * Home network
    * Most likely the same thing as the `Main` Wi-Fi network.
