# Let There Be Light

## About Me

**Name**: Va≈°ek Lorenc

I am a security enthusiast who started as an assembly programmer two decades
ago, learned a lot about computer networks and routing protocols later and
finally realized that computer security is beautiful topic to spend my time
with.

A big fan of 'Big Insight' principle instead of mindless adoration of 'Big
Data'. That and automation, as it can make analyst's life way easier.
